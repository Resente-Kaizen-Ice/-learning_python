a simple python projects that I use for practice

here are some python projects that I use to practice and learn new things about python

## this is composed of
* how to use print statement
* how to initialize variable
* create loops (while and for loop)
* try catch
* conditions (if else and switch case)
* functions
* and a blank file to use for you to do daily task/practice by yourself since practice helps you from getting rusty

**this is usually only composed of basic python programming for beginners such as myself**
